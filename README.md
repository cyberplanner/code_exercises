# code_exercises

The excersice was pretty easy but I solved it with TDD as usual and made it into a CLI program that accepts two CL arguments and return the solution.

### Instructions:

* Clone the repo:
`$ git clone https://github.com/cyberplanner/code_exercises.git`

* Run bundle:
`$ bundle`

* Run the test suite:
`$ rspec`

* To run the CLI:
`$ ./lib/decimal_zip.rb num1 num2`
num1 and num2 are the numbers/arguments.

* if that didn't work, change the premissions by running:
`$ chmod u+x ./lib/decimal_zip.rb`

then try again.
